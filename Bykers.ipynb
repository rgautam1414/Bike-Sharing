    "\n",
    "Bike-sharing systems provide a fleet of bikes which can be rented by users to travel in a city. The network essentially consists of bikes and docks which are situated in different places in an area/city. The users can collect a bike from a dock and deposit it at the same or a different dock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bikesharing is slowly gaining prevalence due to an increase in interest in reducing pollution, traffic, as well as promoting healthy lifestyles. At present San Francisco has multiple bike-sharing companies such as Bay Wheels and JUMP which have become popular especially in the Bay area and University Towns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project intends to find the optimal distribution of bikes to maximize the profit of a Bike Sharing Company called Bykers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The positions of the docks are shown below.\n",

    "## 1.1 Problem Statement ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The project aims to solve a networking problem for allotment of bikes to docks in the San Francisco Bay area. The demand and average revenue from the source to destination for different pairs of source and destination docks have been used to evaluate what would be the optimal allotment of bikes for maximizing the profit of Bykers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rental charges on the bikes are on the basis of the duration of the journey. So a longer journey yields more revenue than the shorter ones. Buying new bikes, setting up the stations, and maintaining the infrastructure involves capital investment. Thus, it is a challenge for the company to figure out how many bikes they should buy, how to allot the bikes to different stations and how to set up their docks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to the problem can further be extended to other car-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bike Sharing Company has a budget of \\\\$200,000 for bikes and with \\\\$1000 as the cost for one bike, the maximum investment can be for 200 bikes. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have also explored the impact on profits if the company follows differential pricing for \"Customers\" and \"Subscribers\" on the given data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The First Step of the Problem deals with finding the optimum number of bikes to satisfy demand and find out the profit  \n",
    "2) The Second Step of the Problem deals with finding the optimum number of bikes to satisfy demand and find out the profit using Premium Pricing.  \n",
    "2) The Third Step of the Problem finds out the optimum placement of bikes to Maximize Profit using Average Demand and Profit \n",
    "3) The Fourth Step of the Problem considers the constraint on Dock Size to find out optimal arrangement to Maximize Profit  \n",
    "4) The Fifth Step includes a cost parameter for the expansion of the Dock to find out optimal allottment to Maximize Profit \n",
    "\n",

    "Our data was collected from a case study provided by Bain and Company for a company based in the Bay Area. We utilize two data sets to solve the problem.

    "\n",
    "From Model 2, we take into account the increase in profit through premium pricing for customers who are not subscribers. The total requirement of bikes to take care of this demand comes out to be 301 since the optimization model will try to fulfill all demand due to the higher possibility of reaping profits. The number of bikes increases to 301 and the profit which the company can earn is \\\\$31,733 i.e an increase of 33% in profit. \n",

However, we can also consider the possibility of rearrangement of bikes at certain points during the day to satisfy the hourly changes in demand from different points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The demand which has been considered is also deterministic. More advanced models can be made which takes into account the real-time demand and/or using the existing demand to forecast future demand using machine learning forecasting models. Biking is also a seasonal activity even though the seasonal effect is much lesser in California where it's fairly warm throughout the year. However, in many other states in the US, the usage during the winter will be drastically different. The lack of revenue during the period should be taken into account."
